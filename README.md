AzerothCore-lua-MultiVendor script written by Psychonautek(Krisande#5411 on Discord)

Multivendor Module written in Lua for Azerothcore with SQL file to insert the npc into your AzerothCore database! 

The code is well documented so you easily can edit and extend it! You will also have to state vendor id's in the script first. so open it up and look where stuff is to change (it is highlighted with a comment line)!

If u want to use the LUA script on TrinityCore read the description to get it working!




!!Description for TrinityCore!!

You will need to grab an edited Playermethods.h from elunaengine. You can find the needed file at the following site to download:

After you have downloaded the file you will need to place it into the following place of your trinity eluna wotlk:

ElunaTrinityWotlk\src\server\game\LuaEngine\ 

Paste the PlayerMethods.h in there and recompile your server!
Afterwards you can use the Lua script of mine for Trinitycore as well! =)

NPC database sided you will have to create your own since i had no trinity database available on creation.. sorry! =)
